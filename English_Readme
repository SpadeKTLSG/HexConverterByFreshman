# HexConverterByFreshman
A carefully cooked shit mountain by a CPP beginner - to remember my freshman time

Hex conversion tool completed by CPP self-made 'wheel', does good job between 2, 8, 10 and 16 decimal conversion, which interactive design is user-friendly

This project includes the following:
---
1. Annoying redundancy
2. Naughty interactive design
3. Stable run even if user sucks

It took about 40 hours of stuttering to get it done, which I was so proud when I showed it in the class cuz it's all done on my own.

It was my first project after saying 'Hello World' to programming world, however now, two years later, I don't wanna watch it again(so pool!) XD.

But that's encouraging: growth means surpass myself in the past by surmount the trials

Who knows, maybe that would become 'Einstein's bench' oneday

“The World as my stage. It's better to dream big.”

Only for share (for fun), usage is not recommended (unless you can extract the method very carefully, it's enough work to write a new one better than that:)
